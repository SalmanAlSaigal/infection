## A pandemic simulation

### [Check out the demo!](https://SalmanAlSaigal.github.io/infection)

Basically, there are a number of people 🔵 and a virus going around! Some people might randomly get infected 🔴, and anybody near them, will have a chance of getting infected as well! People have a change of healing after a while ⚪

You can also see that if some 😈 ignore social distancing and they get sick, they might just fuck up everything for everybody 😯
